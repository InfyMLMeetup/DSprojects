+ [Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science (Udemy)] (https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/learn/v4/overview)

**(By Pramod Hankare)**: Very good course to understand the end to end process of solving variety of problems using various Macihne Learning Algorithms. Uses Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib libraries for Python. Unique course that covers the implementations in Python as well as R. You need to do assignments in both the languages if you aspire to get a certificate. However if you just want to learn you can chose to focus on one language only. Also introduces Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional neural network using Keras framework with Tensorflow backend. Does cover intuitions and programming; does not into details of maths. Kirill and Hadelin are very good teachers. All in all this is a must do course in my opinion. 
    
    > **Tip:** Udemy keeps coming up with 90% discount every few days. So wacth out for them to save money.
